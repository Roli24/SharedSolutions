          REVIEW_RULES="Please review the code and list only violated rules:
          - Naming conventions: Variables must use camelCase, classes must use PascalCase.
          - Logging: Ensure proper logging is present where needed.
          - Exception handling: Always use CustomException.
          - No hardcoded values: Use environment variables or config files.
          - Method size: Methods should follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
          - Unit tests: All new methods must have tests.
          - API standards: Endpoints must follow OpenAPI specifications.
          - SQL safety: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

          If no issues are found, just respond with: '✅ No issues found.'"
